# Labs of Bioinformatics
This repo stores some of the most interesting works for the Bioinformatics course.
The dataset used are:
- mRNA: The most abundant and most studied type of RNA is messenger RNA. In fact, its
measure is closely related to the number of proteins inside the cell. In the end, it is possible to obtain a tabular file in which the value xij represents the amount of expression of the gene i in patient j.
- micro-RNA (miRNA): Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules mainly
involved in the cell's post-transcriptional processes. They have a central region of about 7 nucleotide long (seed region) responsible for the bond that miRNA can form with some genes, thus inhibiting mRNA translation into protein. Such data is a tabular file where the value at position xij represents the amount of expression of miRNA i in patient j.
- meth: The methylation allows altering the resulting protein's functioning by inserting a
methyl group near some specific regions (typically regions of DNA enriched with cytosine and guanine) without modifying the sequence of nucleotide bases. Some areas of DNA have a high level of methylation, while other regions are typically poorly methylated. However, changes in the level of methylation can lead to altered values of proteins' expression. The quantification of the methylation level occurs through tabular files in which the xij value represents the methylation value of the DNA region (called a probe) i in patient j.
- prot: The quantification of the proteome level occurs through tabular files in which the xij value represents the presence of protein i in patient j.
